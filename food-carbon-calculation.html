									<h2>What is the problem?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									A third of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are attributable to the food sector [1], however dietary change could reduce this by 49% [2]. Many people intend to make sustainable food choices [3], but fail to do so at the point-of-purchase [4]. Educating consumers on the environmental impact of their choices during their shop may be a powerful approach to tackling climate change [2]. 
									Envirofy helps to address this requirement by presenting theory- and evidence-based <a href="sustainable_behaviour">behavioural intervention techniques</a>, at the point-of-purchase, when online shopping. 
								</p>

								<header>
									<h2>How does Envirofy calculate the carbon footprint of foods?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
								The carbon footprint of food can be calculated by adding the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted during <strong>production</strong>, <strong>transportation</strong>, and <strong>packaging</strong> of the food [5]: 
								</p>

								<p style="text-align: center;">
								<strong>Total Environmental Impact = Food Production + Transportation + Packaging</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
								The larger this result, the greater the impact of the food on the environment. 
									Envirofy crawls the detail pages for all products from an online grocery retailer and extracts <i>Ingredients</i>, <i>Produce Of</i>, and 
									<i>Recycling</i> information to calculate the Total Environmental Impact (TEI). As a consumer's food waste cannot 
									be determined at the point-of-purchase, it is neglected in the equation. The TEI is calculated for 100 grams of the product.
								</p>

												<h2>Food Production</h2>
											</header>
											<p>
											The CO<sub>2</sub> cost of food production (e.g. environmental impact of growing food) is determined by the ingredients list. On the example of 
											Tesco's Sharwoods Green Label Mango Chutney 227G [6] the ingredients list reads “Sugar, Mangoes (45%), Salt, Acid (Citric Acid), Spices”. 
											The mean CO<sub>2</sub> value for each ingredient is extracted from [2,7] (CO<sub>2</sub> is 
											used as the measure of environmental impact as all publicly available databases provide these data, in contrast to GHG data). As the distribution of 
											ingredients beyond the 45% mango is not clearly stated, an exponential decay function is applied to determine the composition of the 
											remaining 55%: <i>y = a (1 - b) * x</i>; <i>x</i> is the number of remaining items in the list, <i>(1-b)</i> is the decay factor, and <i>a</i> is the remaining 
											percentage (e.g. 55%), and <i>y</i> the amount it contributes to the overall product. Items leading the ingredients list contribute greater towards the 
											final product. If no ingredients list was provided on the product page, the algorithm used the words in the title as a 100% component (e.g. mango from 
											``Tesco Giant Mango Each'').

												<h2>Transportation</h2>
											</header>
											<p>
											The T value is described as: <i>y = d * m * w</i>, where <i>d</i> is the distance travelled, <i>m</i> is the mode of transportation (e.g. lorry, plane), 
											and <i>w</i> is the net weight of the product. From a product's detail page, the list of origin countries is extracted. If there is a single 
											country of origin, the distance between the user and that country's coordinates is calculated in kilometres. Country coordinates are from 
											[8]; and participants' coordinates are retrieved from the online retailer's website, as it collects location data. 
											If multiple countries are listed including the UK, it is first checked whether the product is in season in the UK [9]; 
											if true, the UK is assumed to be the country of origin. If however, the product is not in season in the UK or from outside the UK, the average 
											distance from the participant's location to the other countries is calculated. 

											Transport mode ---lorry, train, ship, plane --- is determined on the distance of the product from the consumer, and whether that product is 
											perishable (e.g. avocados). Perishable foods are transported by train or plane, and non-perishable and frozen foods are transported by sea 
											or lorry [10]. If a product originates in Europe, non-perishable foods are on average transported to the UK via lorries, 
											and perishable foods via train; otherwise via ship or plane [11]. Keywords such as ``perfectly ripe``, ``frozen'', and ``dried'' 
											help determine the mode of transport, as well as categorisation of products into ``fresh'' or ``cupboard''. The net weight of a product is 
											extracted from its detail page.

												<h2>Recycling</h2>
											</header>
											<p>
											The carbon footprint of the packaging is a function of the plastic’s life cycle [12], containing plastic production, recycling, and the waste
											handling of the packaging [13]. If a food item’s packaging consists of recyclable and a non-recyclable components, the P value represents
											both life cycles. If the online retailer does not specify the type of plastic (e.g. polypropylene, polystyrene), the average life cycle cost
											for all plastic [14] is used. The computation of the P value is based on the assumption that all recyclable plastic will be recycled.
