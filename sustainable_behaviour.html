									<h2>Behaviour Intervention Techniques for Sustainability</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Envirofy is the first real-time web-based tool targeting sustainable food shopping behaviour. Here we describe how Envirofy was 
									developed using both behaviour change theory (Behaviour Change Wheel, BCW) [1] and multidisciplinary evidence to support consumers in shopping sustainably. 
									We report how specific behaviour change techniques (BCTs) were translated and "operationalised" within Envirofy's algorithm and interface. BCTs are strategies 
									that help an individual change their behaviour to promote – in this case – sustainable shopping.
								</p>

									<h2>Theoretical Development using the Behaviour Change Wheel</h2>
								</header>

								<header>
									<h3>Steps 1-3. Defining, Selecting, and Specifying the Problem Behaviour</h3>
								</header>

								<p>
									The first steps of the BCW focus on understanding the problem; in this case environmentally damaging food consumption. 
									Stating the problem in behavioural terms helps to define the target of the intervention [1]. This involves considering 
									first all relevant behaviours by relevant groups (step 1); selecting from these to identify a single target behaviour (step 2); 
									and specifying that behaviour as thoroughly and precisely as possible, using pre-specified prompts provided by the BCW (step 3).  
									The final behaviour is specified in Table 1.
								</p>

								<table style="width:100%">
								<caption>Table 1. Specification of the behaviour targeted by Envirofy</caption>
								<tr>
									<th>BCW Question</th>
									<th>Specification</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Who needs to perform the behaviour?</td>
									<td>Individuals who purchase food from supermarkets online.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>What do they need to do differently?</td>
									<td>Select and purchase the most sustainable option from a range of available food products. </td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>When do they need to do it? </td>
									<td>When they are choosing food items, at the point-of-purchase.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Where do they need to do it?</td>
									<td>On supermarket websites, using their device, in locations with internet access.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>How often do they need to do it?</td>
									<td>Every time they visit the online supermarket website.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>With whom do they need to do it?</td>
									<td>Alone or with members of the same household.</td>
								</tr>

								</table>

									<h3>Step 4. What Needs to Change: Why are People Not Making Environmentally Friendly Food Choices?</h3>
								</header>

								<p>
									A core step of the BCW is to identify barriers that are currently stopping individuals from doing the specified behaviour. 
									This helps to understand what problems the intervention should solve and how it should work. A narrative literature review 
									was conducted to identify various barriers to purchasing environmentally friendly foods. APEASE criteria [1] were then systematically 
									applied to each barrier to judge whether it was likely to be Affordable; Practical; Effective/cost-effective; Acceptable to users; 
									and Equitable, to target within an online shopping environment. The resulting barriers targeted by Envirofy are reported in Table 2, column 1. 
									The BCW provides multiple  theoretical tools to interpret and synthesise barriers: (i) COM-B was used to first understand whether, broadly, 
									barriers related to individuals’ “Capability”, “Opportunity”, and/or “Motivation” to engage in a Behaviour (eco-friendly food shopping) 
									(Table 2, column 2) (ii) The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [2] was then used to describe these barriers in more 
									theoretical detail (Table 2, column 3).  In summary, Envirofy targets barriers relating to individual shoppers': knowledge and skills in 
									choosing environmentally friendly foods (i.e. psychological capability); exposure to environmentally friendly foods and opportunity to access 
									these (i.e. physical opportunity); and beliefs relating to "perceived consumer effectiveness" i.e. whether their choices will make an environmental 
									impact (i.e. "reflective motivation").
								</p>

								<caption>Table 2. Selected barriers Envirofy targets towards purchasing environmentally friendly foods</caption>
								<tr>
									<th>Barriers identified in literature</th>
									<th>Broad COM-B category</th>
									<th>Detailed theoretical description (TDF)</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Limited awareness of the association between food choices and environment [3]. Limited factual knowledge about impact of specific food types [4]. Limited skills and understanding of eco labels [5,6].</td>
									<td>Capability (psychological)</td>
									<td>Behavioural regulation (i.e. monitoring food choices in relation to their environmental impact)\newline Knowledge (i.e. of the environmental impact of food groups and individual products)\newline Cognitive and interpersonal skills (I.e. in understanding and using environmental information)</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Perceived lack of time [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] to use environmental information and limited availability of eco-friendly foods [12, 13, 14].</td>
									<td>Opportunity (physical)</td>
									<td>Environmental Context and Resources</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Belief that actions will not have an impact (Perceived Consumer Effectiveness, PCE) [4, 7, 15].</td>
									<td>Motivation (reflective)</td>
									<td>Beliefs about consequences; Beliefs about capabilities</td>
								</tr>

									<h3>Steps 5-8. What Kind of Intervention?: Intervention Functions, Policy Categories, BCTs and Delivery Modes</h3>
								</header>

								<p>
									The BCW provides theoretical links between the barriers identified, and the kinds of interventions that are likely to be effective in addressing them. Following this process, Envirofy was designed to target the barriers identified (see step 4) through Education (to improve knowledge on the environmental impact of food choices), Training (to improve skills in selecting products according to environmental labels), Environmental Re-structuring (to improve exposure to and accessibility of environmentally friendly products), and Persuasion (to target beliefs on perceived consumer effectiveness). The delivery mode (i.e. "digital") and policy ("service provision") were decided in advance. To decide which specific behaviour change techniques (``BCTs'') to embed in this digital tool we again applied APEASE criteria and consulted the multidisciplinary evidence base, including HCI literature, on ways these had been operationalised. The final BCTs and related evidence are reported for each component in <a href="project#publications">Envirofy your Shop: Development of a Real-time Tool to Support Eco-friendly Food Purchases Online</a>
